## 3 FAQ

### 3.1 Configuration

On Windows, how do I fix the following error?
`./venv/Scripts/activate : File .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1 cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled on this system.`

See corresponding [StackOverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56199111/visual-studio-code-cmd-error-cannot-be-loaded-because-running-scripts-is-disabl)

In Visual Studio Code:
* Open the repository as a folder
* Hit F1
* Navigate to: `Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)`
* Ensure that there are no entries for `terminal.integrated.profiles.windows`: delete any that exist.
* Navigate to: `Preferences: Open Workspace Settings (JSON)`
* Add an arbitrary space and then re-save the file
* Reload Visual Studio Code
* "Kill" the old terminal (the bin icon in the top-right of the terminal panel)
* Start a new terminal (Terminal > New Terminal)
* Test this has worked by activating the virtual environment (see instructions above)

### 3.2 Linting

Pre-commit doesn't seem to be checking the code.

This happens when you haven't run `pre-commit install`. See section on pre-commit.
